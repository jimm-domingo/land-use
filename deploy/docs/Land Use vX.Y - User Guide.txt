Land Use version 0.4
LANDIS-II Extension
User Guide

Limitations
-----------
The land use for a site cannot change from a land use that prevents
establishment to a land use that allows establishment.  If this situation
occurs, the extension will print an error message.  This restriction
is due to a limitation in the succession module (library) shared by all
the succession extensions.  It is anticipated that this limitation will
be addressed in the future.
